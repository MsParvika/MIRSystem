Genre classification for songs is a tough and complex problem in MIR systems. In 2018, one of the most comprehensive datasets regarding MIR was published, containing things such as textual meta-data for songs/artists, raw audio files, pre-computed audio features, and hierarchical genres. A formal breakdown of the data is as follows: 518 audio features, undetermined # textual features, 16 genres, around 40,000 tracks per top three genres (experimental, electronic, rock) and less than 10,000 tracks per rest of genres.

We present a comparative study of 6 classification algorithms and reporting metrics on each using SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, and a boosting/ensemble model in this study. In addition, we have done K-Fold Cross Validation.
